✨ *Some notes* ✨

- Most of these notes aren't intended to teach a topic from scratch but are rather notes that I took and compiled during my midterm & finals, might help you remember things, study for exams, and prepare for job interviews.
- There might be very small Turkish notes in few of the pages, you can ignore them.
- I will upload more notes as I find or create them. Will soon compile my Hugging Face cheatsheets so stay tuned!

✨ *Some notes* ✨

- Most of these notes aren't intended to teach a topic from scratch but are rather notes that I took and compiled during my midterm & finals, might help you remember things, study for exams, and prepare for job interviews.
- There might be very small Turkish notes in few of the pages, you can ignore them. One or two of the pages might be not good visually. 
- If you can improve the quality of handwritten notes or convert PDFs to JPEG, feel free to open a PR. (it's appreciated)
- I will upload more notes as I find or create them. Will soon compile my Hugging Face cheatsheets so stay tuned!

*Updates* 🎉
- I uploaded hierarchical clustering and improved version of K-means.
- I compiled every lecture in separate PDFs, and also compiled those into single PDF, found under `Compiled PDF`s in [HF repository](hf.co/datasets/merve/my_notes)(GitHub doesn't accept big files).
- I uploaded Hugging Face cheatsheets.
